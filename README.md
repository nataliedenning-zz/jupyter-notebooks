<h2>About</h2>

The Jupyter notebooks contained in this repo are my portfolio, more or less. They intend to demonstrate a number of my skills and capabilities as a data analyst and data scientist.

<h2>Contents</h2>

As of August 2019, this repo contains the following notebooks:

- **Breast_Cancer_Classification.ipynb**: This notebook uses SciKit-Learn's included dataset on breast cancer tumors. It goes through the process of determining which classification algorithm best predicts the data and picking the best parameters. While not a complex dataset, it illustrates a straightforward process of comparing algorithms.

- **Global_Alcohol_Use_Dataset_Cleanup.ipynb**: This notebook explores one of the datasets regarding global alcohol use from the [Global Health Data Exchange](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2016). Using pandas as well as python dictionaries and functions, I clean up this dataset through data wrangling and feature engineering. After the data is tidy, I briefly explore the use of multi-index hierarchies and pivot tables, discussing their uses and charting their outputs with Matplotlib.

- **Happiness_Visualizations**: This notebook uses Seaborn and Matplotlib to explore data from the [2018 World Happiness Report](http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2018/). Using a variety of tools, including continuous variable bins, correlational heatmaps, and scaled features, I look at the happiness data in multiple regions, across a variety of countries. I also discuss what conclusions we can draw from this data, and what we can't.

- **Happiness_Changes_Over_Time.ipynb**: This notebook uses the same Happiness Report data to explore the changes in happiness measurements for the countries in Southeast Asia. It cleans up the data, using the process of *split, apply, combine*. It then uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover the relationships between these scores within and across countries.

- **World_Happiness_Cleanup**: This notebook demonstrates how to use python functions in order to easily cleanup a large dataset ([2019 World Happiness Report](http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2019/)).
